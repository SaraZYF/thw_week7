This is the group work for team 4.
Below is our user story

As a cocktail lover, I want to be able to search the cocktail recipes based on the different alcohol,
and see the popular cocktail recipe recommendation based on the weather of the day.
I would like to have the function to add the recipes I like under "My Favorite" during the session of visiting the website.

For this project we will use two public APIs

Cocktail Related 'https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/'
Weather Related https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api
